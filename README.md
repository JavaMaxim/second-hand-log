#  The Second-Hand Log

The Second-Hand Log is a tiny extension for the [FirstSpirit CMS](http://www.e-spirit.com/) based on [Rob Camick's Message Console](https://tips4java.wordpress.com/2008/11/08/message-console/).

Its aim is to help FirstSpirit template and module developers during their work in the FirstSpirit SiteArchitect by displaying a message console which displays Java's System.out and System.err output.

In contrast to the Java's JConsole it will keep the log and can be reopened.
